Later then, he had decided to join his former bandmates on stage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_richest_member_of_Journey></span><strong>Who is the richest member of Journey?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of 2022, Arnel Pineda’s net worth is roughly $20 million. Arnel Pineda is a Filipino singer and songwriter from Manila. He came to prominence in the Philippines during the 1980s and internationally in 2007 as the new lead singer of the American rock band Journey.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Steve_Perry_and_Jonathan_Cain_friends></span><strong>Are Steve Perry and Jonathan Cain friends?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>JOURNEY Keyboardist JONATHAN CAIN Has No Relationship With STEVE PERRY: ‘That’s His Loss’ JOURNEY keyboardist Jonathan Cain has confirmed in a new interview that he has had almost no direct contact with the band’s former singer Steve Perry since they were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame two years ago.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Neal_schons_net_worth></span><strong>What is Neal schons net worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Neal Schon Net Worth</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Net Worth:</th><th>$40 Million</th></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth:</td><td>Feb 27, 1954 (68 years old)</td></tr><tr><td>Gender:</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Height:</td><td>5 ft 4 in (1.65 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession:</td><td>Guitarist, Songwriter, Musician, Singer</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_is_Steve_Perry_from_Journey_Now></span><strong>Where is Steve Perry from Journey Now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>For now, Perry is focusing strictly on his own career, far away from the battles of Journey. “The acoustic Traces is going to close the Traces chapter,” he says. “Then I’m opening up another chapter next year at some point.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_many_original_members_of_Journey_are_left></span><strong>How many original members of Journey are left?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Journey keeps on turning,” Schon said, likening the group’s trajectory to another one of its hits.
