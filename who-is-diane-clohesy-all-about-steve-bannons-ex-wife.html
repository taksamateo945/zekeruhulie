In fact, according to reports, they actually first met other in 1999, almost two years after Bannon’s divorce from his former wife. Diane was working as a model at the time, and the two hit it off immediately. They started dating and eventually fell deeply in love with each other.</p><p>When they first started dating, the couple lived together in Laguna Beach, California, for several years before moving to Florida in 2003. They continued their relationship and were reportedly very much in love. Bannon was known for taking care of Diane and ensuring that she never lacked anything. Their relationship was not without its challenges, as Steve was not happy with some of Diane’s spontaneous behavior and cravings, which placed a strain on their relationship.</p><p>However, they remained together as Steve Bannon tried to put her in check most of the time,&nbsp; providing both emotional and financial support.</p><h2><strong>Diane Clohesy Became Steve Bannon’s Wife In 2006</strong></h2><p>In 2006, Diane Clohesy and Steve Bannon tied the knot and became husband and wife after being together for seven years.

Their new home offered a perfect setting for the newlyweds to continue their romance and build their life together.</p><p>At the time, the family and friends of the couple were happy for them and rooting for their marriage to succeed. However, as time passed, their relationship began to experience challenges which eventually led to their divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/steve-bannon.jpeg><h2><b>Their Marriage Lasted for Three Years Before They Split</b></h2><p>Diana Clohesy’s marriage to Steve Bannon lasted for just three years. Despite the goodwill from family and friends, the couple parted ways and got a divorce in 2009, just three years after their marriage. Diane Clohesy and Steve Bannon’s divorce came as a surprise to many who had thought they were a perfect couple.</p><p>However, the exact reason for their divorce remains unknown as neither party has spoken publicly about it. Also, there is no information available about the settlement that Diane received from the divorce. However, given Steve Bannon’s net worth of over $20 million, it is likely that Diane was well taken care of financially.</p><p>Despite their separation, Diane and Steve managed to maintain a cordial relationship with each other. In fact, they continued to work together on various documentary film projects even after their divorce, showing that they were able to put their differences aside and remain professional. It is also worth noting that despite their divorce, Diane and Steve’s paths have continued to cross.</p><p>In 2016, Steve was appointed as the CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and Diane was a vocal supporter of Trump during his election campaign. Also, even after their separation, Steve Bannon continued to support Diane in various ways. Steve rented a house for Diane in Miami-Dade County, Florida, as she continued with her career pursuits.</p><h2><strong>They Did Not Have Any Children Together</strong></h2><p>While they were together, Steve Bannon and Diane Clohesy did not have any children. It is not clear why they did not welcome kids despite being together for several years before getting married for three extra years.</p><p>However, it is noteworthy that Steve Bannon has three children called Maureen Bannon, Emily Piccard, and Grace Piccard from his previous marriages. There are no reports of Diane Clohesy having any child from another relationship.</p><h2><strong>Diane Clohesy Has Had Several Run-ins With the Law</strong></h2><p>Diane Clohesy has had a tumultuous legal history with multiple run-ins with the law. She has been accused of assault, drug-related charges, etc.</p><h3><strong>She was Found Guilty of Assault in 2002</strong></h3><p>In 2002, Diane Clohesy was banned for life from traveling with Aer Lingus, an airline company. The ban was the result of an altercation she had with one of the senior cabin crew managers during a New York to Shannon flight. The incident left a lasting impact on her life, tarnishing her reputation and negatively affecting her career prospects.</p><p>As a consequence of her actions, Clohesy was brought before the Killaloe District Court to face charges of assault and engaging in insulting behavior. She pleaded guilty to the assault and was fined €1,000. On top of the fine, the court ordered her to pay €800 in costs and an additional €250 for pleading guilty to engaging in insulting behavior.</p><p>The legal proceedings and resulting penalties had severe repercussions on Clohesy’s modeling career. The incident, along with her other legal troubles, damaged her public image and made it difficult for her to secure new modeling contracts.</p><h3><strong>She Smuggled Drugs Into Prison</strong></h3><p>Diane Clohesy’s troubles with the law did not end with her airline ban. In 2013, after her divorce from Steve Bannon, she found herself on the wrong side of the law yet again after she was arrested for<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> smuggling</a> drugs and a phone into prison for her then-boyfriend, Victor Ramirez.</p><p>Ramirez was facing multiple charges, including burglary, armed theft, and criminal mischief, and was in jail awaiting trial. In an attempt to maintain contact with him, Clohesy paid a prison guard a bribe of $700 to smuggle a mobile phone and marijuana into the prison for her boyfriend. However, her actions were quickly discovered, and she was investigated.</p><p>The consequences of Clohesy’s actions could have been severe but she got off the hook as she was never charged.<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/Untitled-design-7.png alt="Diane Clohesy" width=696 height=391 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Diane Clohesy</p><h3><strong>She Battled Drug Addiction</strong></h3><p>Diane Clohesy also battled drug addiction. In fact, different reports have emerged indicating that Diane Clohesy has struggled with drug addiction for some time. Sources suggest that Diane had been battling substance abuse for a while but that her addiction spiraled out of control shortly after her divorce from Steve Bannon.</p><p>Diane’s brother, Declan, has described her as one of many Americans struggling with drug and alcohol addiction and revealed that she was also battling depression. Declan also stated that Diane’s ex-husband, Steve, was helping his sister get over the problem. He expressed gratitude to Steve Bannon for always being there for his sister and providing support as she battled an addiction to substances such as ecstasy and marijuana.</p><p>Diane’s addiction led to other legal troubles, including a disturbing incident in March 2017. The police received multiple complaints about a loud argument coming from Diane’s home in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami. Upon arriving at the scene, the police discovered that Diane’s gun had been stolen, and she appeared to be under the influence of drugs.</p><p>She was subsequently arrested for being violent with the police. This incident highlights the severe consequences of drug addiction and the need for individuals struggling with addiction to seek help before it spirals out of control.</p><p>In recent times, Diane has gone a little quiet, and not much is heard from her. Her brother says she continues her recovery from drug addiction and has made an effort to delete the numbers of her suppliers. According to reports, her ex-husband, Steve Bannon, has continued to be actively involved in helping her find help for her addiction.</p><h3><strong>Her Romantic Relationships have Been Marred By Physical Abuse</strong></h3><p>Steve Bannon is not the only man that Diane Clohesy has had a romantic relationship with. In fact, Diane is reported to have had a series of relationships with different men. According to Miami-Dade records, she began dating a man called Pedro Garcia Jr in 2007 while still legally married to Bannon. However, their relationship was marred by allegations of domestic violence.</p><p>In 2009, Pedro accused Diane of physical violence twice, leading to her arrest and a subsequent court order to stay away from him. Despite this, they moved in together in the 79th Street Causeway, but their cohabitation was short-lived. Two weeks later, Pedro filed a restraining order, claiming that Clohesy had smashed a bottle over his head. Ultimately, the relationship ended, and they went their separate ways.</p><p>After the breakup, Diane started dating Pedro’s neighbor, Jose Cavana. However, their relationship also ended in violence. In 2012, Diane alleged that Cavana had accused her of cheating and extorted $50,000 from her. The argument escalated into physical violence, further damaging her already tarnished reputation.</p><p>After the relationship with Jose Cavana ended, Diane began dating Victor Ramirez, but the relationship was short-lived. Ramirez was later arrested and imprisoned. At the moment, Clohesy’s current relationship status is shrouded in secrecy. Diane Clohesy’s tumultuous romantic history is a reminder of the dangers of domestic violence and the importance of speaking out against such abuse.</p><h2><strong>What Does Steve Bannon’s Ex-Wife Do?</strong></h2><p>Diane Clohesy is not only a model and a controversial figure, but she has also worked as a documentary film producer. Despite her tumultuous personal life, she has managed to achieve some success in the film industry as a producer of documentaries.</p><p>In 2004, Diane served as the associate producer of In the Face of Evil: Reagan’s War in Word and Deed, a political documentary that portrays the life and legacy of Ronald Reagan and his actions that helped end the Cold War. This documentary received mixed reviews, with some critics calling it a one-sided account of Reagan’s presidency, while others praised it as a compelling tribute to Reagan’s leadership.</p><p>In 2011, Diane produced the documentary film, The Undefeated, which follows the career of Sarah Palin, the former Governor of Alaska and Vice Presidential candidate. This film aimed to portray Palin in a positive light and counter the negative media coverage she received during the 2008 US Presidential campaign. The documentary was directed by Diane’s ex-husband, Steve Bannon.</p><p>Diane’s work in the film industry continued in 2012 when she served as the assistant producer of two documentaries: Occupy Unmasked, which explores the Occupy Wall Street movement, and District of Corruption, which highlights the corruption in Washington DC and how it affects American politics.</p><p>It is noteworthy that most of these documentary films were produced in collaboration with her ex-husband, Steve Bannon. Despite their tumultuous relationship, the two seemed to work well together in the film industry, making films that contribute to the political discourse in America.</p><p>In 2012, she also served as the script supervisor of the documentary film Generation Zero, which was produced by Bannon and explores the roots of the 2008 financial crisis. Apparently, despite the controversy surrounding Diane, her work in the film industry shows that she has talents and abilities that extend beyond her personal life.</p><h2><strong>Where Is Diana Clohesy Now?</strong></h2><p>Reports have it that Diane Clohesy&nbsp;now lives in Fort Lauderdale, a city on Florida’s southeastern coast, known for its beaches and boating canals. Her brother, Declan, is also said to be in the same city and makes it his duty to be near her as she continues her recovery from addiction.</p><p>The last time Diane produced a documentary was in 2012. Not much is known about what she does now for a living, but it is believed that she and Steve Bannon might soon be collaborating on another project as he has been quite active in her life despite their divorce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecOimKedXZi5sLTErLBmmZyheqKuzq6rZqukmsOmecGapaennqh6psSMsKCfnV8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fresh-gossip-crossword-clue-universal-answer-1146752.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fresh gossip Crossword Clue Universal Answer</a>
