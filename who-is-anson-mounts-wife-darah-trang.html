She is a Vietnamese-Canadian photographer in her own right</strong></p><p>Darah Trang’s husband, known for his role as Cullen Bohannon in AMC’s Hell On Wheels, as well as many others;&nbsp;Anson Mount, is a renowned Hollywood actor who has been enjoying the spotlight for decades but the same cannot be said for his wife Darah Trang. Though a talented photographer, Anson Mount’s wife only became known upon her marriage to the actor and has remained somewhat obscured from the public.</p><h3><strong>Summary Of Darah Trang’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Darah Trang Mount</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Asian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> Vietnamese-Canadian</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Darah Trang’s Husband:</strong> Anson Mount</li><li><strong>Darah Trang’s Children:</strong> one daughter – Clover Ngoc Mount</li><li><strong>Darah Trang’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet and 4 inches</li><li><strong>Darah Trang’s Height in meters:</strong> 1.63 m</li><li><strong>Darah Trang’s Net worth:</strong> $1 million</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> being the wife of Anson Mount</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Photography</li><li><strong>Darah Trang’s Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>callmedarah</a></li><li><strong>Facebook:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Darah Mount[/box]</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Darah Trang is a Vietnamese Woman Born in Canada</strong></h2><p>Her physical features easily give her away as an Asian woman and that is not far from the truth. Trang was born to Vietnamese parents who relocated to Canada to escape the effect of the war in their home country of Vietnam. Thus, her place of birth is in Saint Paul, Alberta in Canada which gives her a Canadian nationality but she still identifies with her Vietnamese nationality.</p><p>In true Trang style, her date of birth has not made it out to the public. Despite being married to a public figure and movie star, she has maintained her privacy policies on certain aspects of her life.</p><h3><strong>She Schooled in Canada and the United States</strong></h3><p>Back in Canada, she spent her formative years in her place of birth and also studied at Alberta College of Art and Design to hone her creative skills. However, her earlier educational background details are not known but she furthered her studies to the highest level. Following her graduation from Alberta College of Art and Design, Trang moved to the United States where she pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts at the School of Visual Arts located in New York.</p><p>She subsequently stayed back in the States to look for greener pastures and build a career in a field she is very passionate about. This has proved to be the right call, with a robust career and her marriage to a man that obviously makes her happy, it’s safe to say Trang is living her American dream.</p><h2><strong>Inside Darah Trang’s Life as Anson Mount’s Wife of 6 Years</strong></h2><p>Without much details about how they met, it is a known fact that Darah Trang and Anson Mount dated for long before they got married. They reportedly met in September 2011 and dated for about six years and on July 8, 2017, Mount announced their engagement. The nature of the circumstances that brought them together is only left for the imagination as they are yet to share such details with the public.</p><p>On February 20, 2018, the couple walked down the aisle and made their union official but details about the wedding ceremony are hardy available as she likes to shy away from the spotlight.</p><h3><strong>Darah Trang and Her Husband Have Become Parents</strong></h3><p>The marriage has already produced a child, a daughter whom they welcomed into the family on December 4th, 2021. They named her Clover Ngoc Mount and according to Darah, the little one arrived earlier than anticipated. Her daughter has made a few <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>appearances</a> on her Instagram page.</p><p>Darah Trang currently resides in Brooklyn, New York, with her family which also includes dogs. Her love for the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>canine community</a> is evident in the pictures on her Instagram page. She seems to share that passion with her husband.</p><h2><strong>Darah Trang is a Professional Photographer</strong></h2><p>While a lot of people might not see photography as a serious career path, many like Darah Trang have built a robust profession from it. Anson Mount’s wife is a professional photographer but her career portfolio is not open to public scrutiny, neither does she subscribe to the glitz and glam of the showbiz industry. However, evidence of her work and passion for photography can be seen on her social media accounts, especially Instagram where she has beautiful pictures of diverse things, particularly animals. Her love for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>animals</a> can also be sensed on her Instagram page.</p><p>As a professional photographer, she has landed high-profile deals and worked with fashion agencies as well. Relocating to the United States has proved to be the right call for her as she’s doing well in her career. Even as a married woman, her career has continued to thrive and she seems to love what she does for a living.</p><h3><strong>Anson Mount’s Wife Also Had a Career in the Finance Industry</strong></h3><p>It has been established that Darah studied art in college but before she embraced her craft as a photographer, Darah Trang was a finance officer. She apparently set her art degree aside to work for the money, starting as a finance officer at Academy Group of Companies in Canada. Her time at the pipe fabrication company lasted from 2008 to 2013 and those five years were not wasted.</p><p>The next stop for Darah Trang in the finance industry was LaPrairie Crane and Northland Fleet of Calgary. Both organizations are in Canada and she tried to forge a career with them before her move to the United States opened her eyes to career opportunities in her passion for photography. The craft has seen her work on remarkable projects and events.</p><h3><strong>Darah Trang is a Philanthropist</strong></h3><p>Being the wife of a celebrity comes with privileges that include a huge fan base which you can leverage for a lot of things. In Darah Trang’s case, her social media followers come in handy when she’s on a humanitarian cause. She used her Facebook platform to seek help for the victims of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, asking her followers for donations to help the affected families.</p><p>She also seems to be a dedicated animal lover as seen in most of the photos she shares on her social media pages. Darah loves dogs and other animals also have a special place in her heart. Darah Trang is living happily with her family and her ever-smiling face is enough proof.</p><h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2><li><strong>Who is Darah Trang?</strong> Darah Trang is a Canadian professional photographer, philanthropist, and author.
