Since 2008, he has managed to break countless records, win hundreds of awards (including a long-overdue Grammy) and now holds many titles which no one can take away from him. Justin Bieber is most certainly a name that you’ll keep hearing for many years to come, and it’s definitely a name that will appear in the history books decades from now. All of this is thanks to his fanbase, his loyal Beliebers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-04-300x177.jpg alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 4" width=480 height=283 sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>In this article, we bring to you just some of the many faithful Beliebers around the world that stood by Justin and helped him reach his most wildest dreams and goals in life, and we ask the about the impact that Justin has had on their lives.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-04.gif alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 4" width=454 height=454 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Sabrina | 15 | Indiana, US:</strong>&nbsp;“I love Justin because he’s been there for me through everything and his music has helped me through a lot. I’ve been there for him through everything these past seven years! Through all the drama with girlfriends and just everything that has happened. I never thought about leaving him or the fandom anytime throughout his difficult/troubling times. I was disappointed in him, sure, but I never thought about leaving him. If I am in a bad mood or am feeling upset all I have to do is listen to Justin’s music and I feel 100% better!</p><p>Justin has made a huge impact on my life ever since 2009! He has never had a negative impact on my life, it’s always been positive!! He’s showed me so many things like: don’t listen to the haters, don’t let people bring you down, if you have a dream then chase it, and just things like that! He’s such a positive influence in my life and I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better role model!

I love him because he has such an incredible big heart, and a loving personality, he’s such a dork but he’s so kind, sweet and caring, I mean his looks is just a bonus. honestly his smile just brightens my day, he’s so adorable. Justin is so appreciative and loving towards all his beliebers. He’s crazy talented and his music has inspired so many people to keep going and to stay positive through their tough times, if I’m having a bad day his music can help me to remain positive, and remember that it will all be alright, his music is there for me when no one else is :)”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-06.gif alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 6" width=300 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Merjema | 14 | Bosnia and Herzegovina:</strong> “I love Justin Bieber because he changed my life for the better. I’ve been following him since 2009, and I’ve always been there for him, just as he has always been there&nbsp;for us Beliebers. He taught me to believe in my dreams, my hopes, and myself. I’ve spent countless late nights thinking about Justin, whether I’ll ever go to his concert, whether I’ll ever meet him. I’ve cried many times because he’s never even herd of me, and he probably won’t. But that’s okay, I love him so much, and I know everything about him.</p><p>I know how he was a poor kid on the street with nothing but a bottle of water, his guitar, and a big dream- to make enough money for himself and his mother. Justin’s talent came through, and in a short while be became the most famous singer in the world. His fame spread. Over the years everything changed. His voice changed, his appearance changed. Many have left, and many have joined this biggest fandom in the world. The thing that makes me the proudest Belieber is that this fame didn’t change his soul, and that’s why I still love him. One more time- I love you Justin. Once a Belieber, always a Belieber.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-02-300x287.png alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 2" width=487 height=465 sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Natalie | 23 | UK:</strong> “I love Justin Bieber because he’s talented, generous and kind. He is always giving back whether it’s donating money to charity or meeting fans who are terminally ill. He has a good heart and appreciates his fans. I became a belieber in 2010 after hearing his song ‘One Time’ on TV. At the time I was struggling with self harm, depression and I was experimenting with drugs and alcohol because of personal problems but becoming a belieber, I gained a new identity and I made new friends with other beliebers all over the world.</p><p>Justin inspired me to be a better person and I enrolled in college, stopped using drugs and I had the courage to get the help I needed. I found happiness in supporting Justin and seeing him in concert. I would attend Bieber buyouts and even started an organisation to help other less fortunate beliebers get tickets to his believe world tour which raised over £5000. I now spend my spare time running a UK fan Twitter account for Justin which is <a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" href=#>@UK_Biebernews</a> I could never not be a Belieber, it’s a part of who I am! And I’ll always support and respect Justin”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-03-300x163.gif alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 3" width=497 height=270 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=DMAvatar-container><strong>Sophie | 15 | Scotland:</strong> “I love Justin because he’s such a kindhearted person, and he has a heart of gold and his voice is just amazing no words can really describe his voice in my opinion, I also love Him because he has helped me make so many friends via the fandom, and he has done so much for me, I suffer from epilepsy and when I’m feeling my worst, his music cheers me up, or even when I’m just low or upset his voice cheers me up and if it weren’t for Justin and his music I don’t know where I’d be but I wouldn’t be as happy and content as what I am right now, I constantly listen to his music because I can’t bare to not listen to him, I’m hooked, I love him. So much. No words can describe how much. And I can’t thank him enough because without him I wouldn’t be looking at the positives of my epilepsy and the whole situation. He has taught me to never say never!! When you’re a Belieber you try and stop loving him, but you can’t, you fall even harder for him.

To start off, I have been a Belieber since 2009 and I have never stopped supporting Justin. I love Justin because he is so inspirational to me and he has such an amazing relationship with his beliebers and genuinely cares about each and every one of us. When the times get tough for him, we all stick together and support him and he shows us that he will never give up and when the world starts hating on him, he doesn’t let that affect him and he just soldiers on through it all, and to me that is truly inspiring. For me, Justin has taught me to never give up, to always follow my dream and when times get tough, to keep going. When I’m down, his songs brighten my day and the times I have been lucky enough to see him live, I end up the happiest girl alive. One of the biggest impacts for me was at V Festival, I was six rows from the front and Justin was getting emotional whilst talking and me and 2 other girls made the heart with our hands and Justin looked at us with so much emotion and almost gratitude, that moment was something I will never ever forget! I am so grateful to Justin for always brightening my day and I will support him no matter what”</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-07.gif alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 7" width=403 height=329 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>Nejla | 15 | Maglaj, Bosnia and Herzegovina:</strong> “When you get to know a person and everything about them, that person becomes a part of your life, at least some aspect of your life. That’s how it is with me and Justin Bieber. He and his songs simply snuck their way into my heart. And by “he” I didn’t mean his fame and his money, I meant the face that he’s humane and that he has a big heart, but of course he makes mistakes just life all of us, and that’s normal. The love I have for him is unexplainable. That love isn’t just there for his voice or his songs, but it’s a love that no one can destroy. Beliebers are fans who know everything about Justin, a Belieber is a promise.</p><p>He taught me to believe and never give up on what I want. He also taught me that there’s a purpose for everything, and that dreams do come true. He simply taught me to love myself the way that I am. Some people hate him, but why? Because they don’t know anything about him, because those people will never achieve what Justin has achieved. They’ll never be as humane and as honest as he is. He has changed my life, thanks to him I have the confidence I never had. Thanks to him I believe and I never give up. His smile makes me happy and his tears make me cry. Haters don’t understand how much it hurts his fans when they insult him. They tell me I’m opsessed but no one was there for me when he was. I’m not ashamed to be a Belieber, we’re a big family and no one can break us. My only dream is to meet him and to thank him for being here for all of us all along. He’s my hero anf I love him with all my heart.”</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-08-300x223.png alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 8" width=482 height=358 sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>Alice | 17 | London, United Kingdom:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve been a Belieber since the very beginning. It probably sounds weird but at times I felt like I had no one I knew that I could rely on both him as a person/role model and as a musician. His music was something that always spoke to me on a personal level and really resonated with me and was something that made me feel better when I was battling with depression, bulimia, and social anxiety. I’ve been in and out of hospitals for such a long time, trying to re-train myself to eat again and not hurt myself. It took me such a long time to realise that I was worth something and did have a purpose. I think what really stands out about him is just how relatable he is. He’s human just like us and experiences many of the same emotions and is so real at times it’s hard not love him. I know that there were so many times when I’ve felt like giving up and even though I’m still not completely recovered and still have bad days, I know that there will also be good days. He’s had such a big influence on my life and my journey as a person, and I’m so happy to call him someone that I look up to as source of hope. Due to my social anxiety I’ve also never really had many friends, so in my loneliest moments listening to his music or just him speaking really made me feel like I wasn’t alone, and that’s something that I’ll be forever grateful for. He’s helped change and mould me as a person and I’m proud of the person I’m becoming. I love him so much and am so proud of the person he’s becoming and will always support him no matter what.”</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-04-300x145.png alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 4" width=553 height=267 sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>&nbsp;So there you have it. What makes Beliebers love Justin? Everything. He helps them deal with reality, he makes them smile, he makes them emotional, he makes them believe, he makes them proud, he makes them happy, he makes them want to work hard, both in life and on themselves. Beliebers have learnt a lot about Justin, and meanwhile he made them learn about themselves too, even if they’re unaware of it. Both have been there for each other, and both have helped each other when times got tough and when they thought they had no one by their side. And it’s been that way for years.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-05.gif alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 5" width=510 height=252 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The truth is, the relationship between Justin and Beliebers has all the aspects of what a real family is. Sure, sometimes they don’t see eye to eye, sometimes they disappoint each other, sometimes they say things they don’t really mean, sometimes they unknowingly take the wrong path, but at the end of the day the love and support that this family has for each other is strong enough to overcome all of these obstacles, and they both know that they’ll always have each other’s back. They make each other happy, isn’t that all that should matter?</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-05-300x144.png alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 5" width=546 height=262 sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-02-300x126.gif alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 2" width=514 height=216 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/we-spoke-with-justin-bieber-fans-to-find-out-why-they-love-him-so-much-01-300x126.gif alt="We spoke with Justin Bieber fans to find out why they love him so much 1" width=515 height=216 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Feel free to send us (<a href=#>@CelebMixJB</a>) your story too, and we may add it to the article!
