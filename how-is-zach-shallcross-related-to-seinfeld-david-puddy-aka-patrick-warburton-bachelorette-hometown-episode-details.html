This came as a major surprise to everyone. On Twitter, people started debating the reasons he might have attended the show as soon as it became available to viewers. Some started asking if Patrick was Zach’s father as many people tried to figure out who he was actually related to on the show.</p><p>But in reality, Zach Shallcross’ uncle is Seinfeld David Puddy, played by Patrick Warburton. As the episode aired, it was revealed, and fans couldn’t control their excitement online. Memes and excitement have taken over Twitter to the fullest extent.</p><p>Tweet reads, “So we’re simply not going to bring up the fact that Patrick Warburton, a.k.a. Kronk/Joe Swanson/Lemony Snicket, is Zach’s uncle? I’m just geeking out here, so please excuse me.”</p><p>Similar to Emy Lacroix, an entertainment journalist, “My family’s journey from thinking Zach’s uncle looks familiar to thinking he looks and sounds suspiciously like Patrick Warburton to realizing he IS Patrick Warburton was nothing short of exhilarating.”</p><p>Many people believe that Zach’s selection by the reality show was solely based on his relationship with Puddy.
