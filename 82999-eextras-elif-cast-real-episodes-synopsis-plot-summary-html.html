Out of desperation, her mother Melek takes her to live at the rich Emiroglu family so that she can run away from an abusive stepfather who plans to sell her.</p><p class=align-left>Elif is not aware that Kenan Emiroglu, the eldest son in the family, is her real father. Kenan is also unaware that her biological daughter lives in his household. Kenan had fallen in love with Melek, but she had to go away from the household to ensure Elif is safe. Elif's safety at the Emiroglu family is not guaranteed, but she survives through the struggles until season five when her mother settles with Mahir, and they live happily as a family.</p><h2>Elif synopsis</h2><p class=align-left>Elif lives with her mother and step-family. At barely five years old, Elif acts more mature than her step-siblings, Zeynep and Murat. She stays strong and preserves the cruelty of Veysel, her stepfather. Veysel is an addicted gambler who abuses both Melek and her daughter. He has plans to sell Elif to clear his gambling debts, but Melek finds it out. She asks her friend Ayse to help her save her daughter.</p><p class=align-left>Ayse works as a servant at the rich Emiroglu household, where Melek used to be a servant too. Ayse learns the truth about why Melek got married to an abusive husband. She had fallen in love with Kenan Emiroglu, and the rich son loved her equally. However, she could not endure his evil mother's dislike of her. She had to flee while pregnant with Elif and make it look like she had turned her back on Kenan.</p><p class=align-left>Kenan later married Arzu. On the other hand, Melek started living another life, then welcomed Elif to the <a href=#>world</a>. She tied the knot with Veysel. She had to endure difficulties while raising her daughter but never revealed who she really is. Desperation has led her to place Elif under Ayse's care.</p><p class=align-left>Elif, unaware that she lives with her real father, settles down in the Emiroglu household. Her presence at the wealthy household changes her life and that of other members of the family. She is a strong girl and can be without her mother.</p><p class=align-left>While at the Emiroglu household, she has to endure Arzu's evilness. Elif and her mother survive death at the hand of Arzu, but Kenan dies. She starts living with Yusuf, a bookstore owner, who marries Melek. Unfortunately, Yusuf dies in an accident.</p><p class=align-left>Elif is again separated from her mother and starts living at the Macide's house. She and her mother face problems at the Haktanir household when Kiymet, Mahir's mother, comes to seek revenge. Melek meets Mahir by chance, and they fall in love.
