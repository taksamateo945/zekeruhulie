With features like relationships, attraction, sex, and desperation, the picture was mostly aimed at the younger age. Bianca, a teen girl who wants to go out with Joey but can’t until her older sister Kat finds a date for herself, is the subject of the story. The events of this odd dating battle between sisters take a humorous turn when Patrick, a “bad boy” paid to court Kat, joins them.</p><p>Julia Styles plays a bright and shining character, while Heath Ledger plays Patrick, a lovely stud. Future star Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Larisa Oleynik also appear in the film. The film was a breakout success for each of the actors that starred in it, with Stiles, Ledger, and Levitt winning numerous teen-oriented honors.</p><h3><span id=Taken_2008>Taken (2008)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Taken.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>“I’ll find you and kill you.” Liam Neeson’s tough dialogue, delivered with a badass attitude, is one of the best lines in the film and has spawned a slew of memes. ‘Taken’ tells the story of Bryan Mills, who goes on a killing spree when his daughter is taken in Paris by sex traffickers.</p><p>This is the film for you if you like some asskicking sequences, superb acting, a well-constructed narrative, and a dash of violence and blood in one package. ‘Taken,’ directed by Luc Besson, is a puzzling chase and run film that does a good job of honoring its characters and script. The film tackles the issue of human and sex trafficking while also incorporating a complex father-daughter connection. Liam Neeson is outstanding in every aspect of his performance, from acting to action, and gives his best performance since Star Wars, in a role that has revolutionized his career. Maggie Smith also does a good job and blends in well with the rest of the cast. ‘Taken’ made $226 million at the box office and was followed by two sequels, ‘Taken 2’ and ‘Taken 3’. In 2017, NBC premiered a prequel/revised television series with Clive Standen as Mills.</p><h3><span id=Tape_2001>Tape (2001)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Tape.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Linklater enlisted the help of long-time friend Ethan Hawke, as well as Uma Thurman and Robert Sean Leonard, to create a psycho-drama that is still remembered today. ‘Tape’ is about three persons who have banded together to solve the unsolved riddles of their high school days, and they do it by sharing harsh truths at times and withholding facts at other times. And, as the credits roll, we learn about everyone’s actual spirit and motivation, which has guided them to their own destinations. One of Richard Linklater’s underappreciated films.</p><h3><span id=Taxi_Driver_1976>Taxi Driver (1976)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Taxi-Driver.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=913 height=550 sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Travis Bickle, an ex-marine who was honorably discharged after the Vietnam war, suffers from chronic insomnia in this 1976 psychological thriller. The video chronicles his life as a cab driver in New York and focuses on how events in his environment affect him.</p><p>Martin Scorcese directed this film, which is considered one of his best to date. The film stars Robert De Niro, who is well known for his role in ‘The Godfather II’ (1974). De Niro is both effective and stunning, and it appears that he has properly researched his character and is aware of the risks he is taking. His portrayal of Travis is incredibly captivating and a testament to his acting prowess, which he has demonstrated in practically all of his subsequent works. Another piece of supplementary material in the film is Jodie Foster, who was just 13 at the time of filming. With her performance, the future Oscar winner wins hearts.</p><p>That year, the picture won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, as well as three other awards. The low-budget film grossed $28 million in theaters. In addition, the picture received the Palme d’Or at Cannes and was chosen for preservation by the National Film Registry in 1994.</p><h3><span id=Three_Kings_1999>Three Kings (1999)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Three-Kings.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=695 height=345 sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The film is set in Iraq in the aftermath of the Gulf War and follows four US Marines on a robbery to recover Kuwaiti gold hidden in Iraq for themselves. The film is a sarcastic and comedic take on the life of combat troops stranded in boredom and loneliness in the aftermath of war, directed by David O. Russell. The video depicts the post-war state of Iraqi people and their rebellion against Saddam Hussein’s tyranny via the desperation and frustration of four soldiers. The film is primarily shot using hand-held cameras, which adds realism and sets it apart from previous films in this genre. The film ‘Three Kings,’ which starred George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg in lead roles and reshaped both of their careers, was a critical and commercial success.</p><h3><span id=Titanic_1997>Titanic (1997)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Titanic.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=650 height=424 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>RMS Titanic sets sail on her first journey in 1912, unaware that what lies ahead for it and the lives on board is an early and tragic conclusion. While the ship travels, two passengers, Jack and Rose, discover a means for their love to flourish and make efforts to leave their conventional worlds behind.</p><p>‘Titanic,’ a James Cameron epic romantic tragedy, is a name that will always come to mind when it comes to love and passion in movies. Cameron has captured his amazing love story on television with such heart and commitment that watching it is always a treat. Despite the fact that ‘Titanic’ is largely a love story, Cameron’s masterpiece never deviates from the tragic tragedy it is designed to depict.</p><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, the film’s two prizes, are also Cameron’s two presents to the business. DiCaprio, an Academy Award winner, gets his big break in the picture, and he gives a faultless performance, growing as an adult actor and leaping well beyond his previous performances. As gorgeous Rose, Kate Winslet is fascinating. At first glimpse, her gleaming eyes make everyone fall in love with her. Kate used to write letters to Cameron signed as Rose before she was cast in the starring role, demonstrating her dedication to the project.</p><p>The film received 14 Academy Award nominations and won 11, tying it with ‘Ben-Hur’ (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film. However, while Winslet took home the award for Best Actress, Leo’s exclusion from the list of nominees was widely panned. The film grossed $1 billion at the box office, making it the highest-grossing picture of all time until 2009, when Cameron’s follow-up, “Avatar,” topped it. In 2012, a 3-D version of the picture was released, bringing the total box office to almost $2 billion.</p><h2>ALSO READ : <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">37 Psychological Thrillers On Netflix That Will Leave You Surprised</a></h2><h3><span id=To_Kill_A_Mockingbird_1962>To Kill A Mockingbird (1962)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/To-Kill-A-Mockingbird.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=1024 height=577 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>In a time and place where discrimination between black and white people is the norm, Atticus Finch defends Tom Robinson, a black man, in a rape case against him. ‘To Kill A Mockingbird,’ based on Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, is one of those rare films that presents a straightforward and simple message in the plot in an exceptional and outstanding manner, and is able to thrive in the hearts of its viewers for maybe eternity. The video examines black and white discrimination, as well as issues of honor, equality, and defying societal expectations. Finch is played by Gregory Peck, who has become a figure of valor among fans over the years. He has stated that of all the characters he has portrayed, Finch is the one that people most often associate with him.</p><p>The film is ranked in the top ten of the American Film Institute’s 100 greatest films of all time, and it won three Academy Awards out of eight nominations, including Best Actor for Peck, a clear win for him. Peck was also nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance in the picture.</p><h3><span id=Top_Gun_1986>Top Gun (1986)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Top-Gun.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Pete Mitchell, codenamed “Maverick,” is admitted into Miramar’s prestigious Fighter School, popularly known as “Top Gun.” The plot is around his experiences and rivalry at Top Gun while falling in love with Charlie, as well as how he handles with his fellow pilots’ repeated taunts over a traumatic occurrence involving his father.</p><p>‘Top Gun’ is one of those early movies that you watch to enjoy rather than to review. Technical inaccuracies, facts, parallels to real-life entities, and so on are irrelevant to you. But all you have to do is watch the damn thing and get some nice ideas into your head. Tom Cruise is the focus of the picture. Everything about him is absolutely incredibly appealing and it’s definitely cool, from his appearance, his hair, his military-like mentality, and not to mention the great aviators that established a long-lasting trend. The film is a surprising entertainer, combining military action, romance, emotions, and drama in a seamless manner.</p><p>Despite the poor reviews, the picture grossed over $350 million on a $15 million budget, establishing Tom Cruise as a market trend and propelling him to celebrity status. The National Film Registry protected the film in 2015.</p><h3><span id=Toy_Story_1995>Toy Story (1995)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Toy-Story.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Toy Story’ is a buddy movie about two toys, Woody, a cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure, and their adventure to reunite with their owner Andy, as Andy prepares to move to a new house.</p><p>Although the plot is rather standard, the fact that it is the first of its kind distinguishes it from all subsequent computer-animated films. The film is Pixar’s first feature-length film, and it represents the start of the first Disney-Pixar partnership, which ended in 2006 when Pixar was acquired by Disney. It is also the first Disney-Pixar film to examine the subject of friendship with a heartfelt message for audiences of all ages, a theme that they would continue to explore in subsequent films such as ‘Finding Nemo,’ ‘Up,’ and ‘The Good Dinosaur.’ The film’s melodic score and Tom Hanks and Tim Allen’s vocal portrayals have made it an enduring work of cinematic art.</p><p>The film was nominated for three Academy Awards and grossed $373 million at the box office, making it a box office smash. It produced two further sequels, ‘Toy Story 2’ (1999) and ‘Toy Story 3’ (2001). (2010). The third installment of the film will be released in 2019.</p><h3><span id=Trainspotting_1996>Trainspotting (1996)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Trainspotting.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=1024 height=531 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Trainspotting,’ a film that captures the essence of heroin misuse and influence, follows young Renton’s efforts to break free from his addiction while battling his friends’ influences and his own needy nerves. The film, directed by Danny Boyle, is packed with gruesome scenes of dark abuse, brutality, filth, and roughness. And it’s all of this that elevates this film to new heights. Thanks to Boyle’s directing, which elevates this film above typical cinematic fare. At every turn, the film transforms and redefines cinematic experiences, defying viewers’ hackneyed expectations and providing something fresh in every frame.</p><p>The film, starring Ewan McGregor, Kelly Macdonald, and Johnny Lee Miller, is ranked 10th among the Top 100 British films of the twentieth century. Danny Boyle directed the sequel, ‘T2: Trainspotting,’ which was released in 2017.</p><h3><span id=Training_Day_2001>Training Day (2001)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Training-Day.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Training Day’ follows LAPD officer Jake Hoyt on his first day on the narcotics unit, when he is assigned to Det. Alonzo Harris, a decorated cop. The crew of a rookie cop narrative has a lot of rookies in it. It was Antoine Fuqua’s third directorial endeavor, and it starred Ethan Hawke, who was still developing a mark in mainstream cinema. It was scripted by David Ayer (his second script), and it was directed by Antoine Fuqua. Denzel Washington’s arrogant and egotistical portrayal of Harris was the only significant aspect of the film. Hawke’s performance, which was a career-defining role for him, was equally lauded.</p><p>Hawke and Washington were both nominated for Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor, with Washington taking home the award. A TV series based on the film, starring Bill Paxton and Justin Cornwell, premiered on CBS in 2017, but was canceled after one season owing to Paxton’s death.</p><h3><span id=Transcendence_2014>Transcendence (2014)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Transcendence.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=640 height=270 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>When polonium-laced gunshot kills scientist Dr. Will Craster, his wife plans to transfer his consciousness into a quantum computer, effectively rescuing him. What she doesn’t know is that she has doubts about whether her consciousness belongs to Will or not. The film, directed by long-time cinematographer Wally Pfister in his directorial debut, was funded by none other than Christopher Nolan, the modern king of science fiction. They brought in Johnny Depp, Paul Bettany, Cillian Murphy, and Morgan Freeman since that wasn’t enough. These points dispel any doubts about the film’s quality. The film’s combination of emotions and science makes it an enjoyable watch, aside from a visionary producer, artistic director, and a wonderful ensemble.</p><p>Critics have panned the film, but in my opinion, give it a chance for Depp’s sake, and you’ll wind up appreciating it for reasons other than him. In 2012, the film was included on the “Black Selection,” a list of the most fascinating screenplays yet to be made.</p><h3><span id=Tron_1982>Tron (1982)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Tron.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The sci-fi adventure follows Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer who is stranded in a software world controlled by a computer mainframe, as he interacts with the realm’s programs and strives to return to his actual world.</p><p>This visually stunning film from Walt Disney Pictures is the film that revolutionized the use of computer graphics and visual effects in Hollywood. It set a precedent among major studios, which used the picture as a source of inspiration to enhance their animation skills and realize the possibilities of visual effects, which we can still see in present films. The film’s intriguing music is another audience pleaser. The picture, which starred Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner, was nominated for two Academy Awards and won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement 14 years later.</p><p>The film’s popularity and cult following resulted in a franchise that includes computer games, comic novels, and an animated series. The sequel, ‘Tron: Legacy,’ was released in 2010, and got mixed reviews from critics. Its soundtrack, composed by Daft Punk, earned a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for a Visual Media, just like its predecessor.</p><h3><span id=Tropic_Thunder_2008>Tropic Thunder (2008)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Tropic-Thunder.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Tropic Thunder,’ a humorous story about a film team shooting for a war picture, is a film you’ll never want to remove off your wishlist. The film follows a fictional film crew as they work to finish a documentary about the Vietnam War. The picture, directed by Ben Stiller, is a blend of comedy, laughing, gags, and pleasure, making it an all-time happy material for everybody who sees it. Robert Downey Jr. also appears in the picture, and he gives one of his greatest comedic performances to date. Jack Black, the third co-star, is as good as he always is. The unexpectedly outstanding performance by Tom Cruise, who is in a wholly unique and memorable avatar, is what elevates this film.</p><p>The picture, which also starred Jay Baruchel, Steve Coogan, and Danny McBride, was a surprise smash, grossing $188 million worldwide and earning Downey an Academy Award nod for Best Supporting Actor and Crusie a Golden Globe nomination in the same category.</p><h3><span id=Troy_2004>Troy (2004)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Troy.jpg alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" width=1024 height=465 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Greek King Agamemnon’s invasion of Troy is chronicled in ‘Troy,’ which begins when his brother’s wife, Helen of Sparta, abandons him for Paris, the young Prince of Troy. The film is based on the Greek classic “Illiad,” which depicts a decade-long Trojan battle in a short period of time. Achilles, played by Brad Pitt, is the main character in ‘Troy,’ which was written by David Benioff, the writer of ‘Game of Thrones.’ Pitt’s portrayal of the character is enthralling, as he is both furious and haughty while being honorable and sympathetic. Orlando Bloom plays Paris, the film’s second protagonist, who is kind-hearted but unyielding. Bloom is fresh off his recent triumph in ‘Lord of the Rings,’ and he captures the young prince’s charm and charisma in a mesmerizing way.</p><p>But the best part of the movie, in my opinion, is Eric Bana’s performance as Hector, the eldest Prince of Troy. He’s a man of honor, but his family and friends come first in his life. His portrayal of the role is practical while also being heroic, and he never gives up a battle. Eric’s skills have improved dramatically from ‘Black Hawk Down’ (2001) to ‘Hulk’ (2003), and he continues to woo the audience with his performance.</p><p>The film grossed $473 million in theaters and is widely regarded as the best historical war film of the century. Sean Bean, Rose Byrne, Garrett Hedlund, and Diane Kruger all appear in supporting roles.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="comedy movies that start with t,movies that start with t 2020,horror movies that start with letter t,disney movies that start with letter t,top movies that start with letter t,popular movies that start with letter t,comedy movies that start with the letter t,kid movies that start with the letter t,animated movies that start with the letter t,5 letter movies that start with t,recent movies that start with the letter t" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
