href=#>Greed</a>” out on all music streaming platforms TODAY (March 3rd), we are sure that Auti has a veryyyy bright year ahead, and we seriously can’t wait to see what else she has in store for 2023.</p><p>When asked how her hot new track “Greed” came to be, Auti revealed in an EXCLUSIVE interview with <strong>Celeb Secrets</strong>, “My dad and I were sitting at a restaurant when we somehow got started on the topic of extremely rich people, both in money and power. Eventually, we both ended up just disgusted with the use of that money and power.”</p><p>“Of course, there can be major consequences to just throwing money around and using your power for change, but if done in a responsible way, you can really change the world for the better,” she continued.</p><p>Given the personal anecdote Auti shared surrounding “Greed,” it is clear that all of her songs are based on personal experiences and/or feelings about a certain topic, ultimately highlighting the authenticity of her music as a whole.</p><p>The rising singer-songwriter confirmed this theory by describing herself as a “huge empath” and going on to reveal that one of her goals as an artist is “to spread light through [her] music and make a change in the world” by sharing her raw, genuine emotions.</p><p>Just one shuffle of Auti’s music and it is clear that she does EXACTLY that!</p><p>“I think my biggest message as a human is ‘you’re not alone,’ which is meant in a sense of someone loves you, someone will be there for you in your darkest moments, but also that whatever you’re feeling mentally, as dark as it may go, someone else is feeling that or has felt that at some point in their life,”&nbsp;Auti&nbsp;revealed passionately. “Knowing that those same people have gotten through that darkness is a perfect reminder that you’ll be okay.”</p><p>She continued and said, “As for my message in my music, I think it carries the same weight. As deep and emotional as a song may be or as fun and pop as it may get, vibe with that in whatever way you do and know that every line you’re listening to is something that I’ve felt.”</p><p>“Even if [my music] as simple as changing one person’s life for the good, I’d be happy,” she revealed as her overarching goal as an artist.</p><p>Read our full Q&A with Auti below, where we talk ALL things “Greed” and more. Be sure to let us know what you think of the budding superstar by either leaving a reaction at the bottom of the post or by sending us a&nbsp;tweet at <a href=#>@celebsecrets</a>.</p><p>You can connect with Auti and stay tuned on any upcoming releases and/or shows by giving her a follow on Instagram at <a href=#>@autimusic</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Auti_Greed_3000-scaled.jpeg><p><b>Celeb Secrets: Your new song “Greed” dropped on all music streaming platforms TODAY (March 3rd) – Where did this title come from?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong>&nbsp;“The title for ‘Greed’ came after I had started writing the song. Reading back on the lyrics within it left open the perfect use for ‘Greed’ as a title. It was different, in your face, and it really concluded the meaning of the song with just one word.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;“</span></p><p><b>CS: Can you tell us a little bit about the meaning/story behind this track?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “My dad and I were sitting at a restaurant when we somehow got started on the topic of extremely rich people, both in money and power. Eventually, we both ended up just disgusted with the use of that money and power. Of course, there can be major consequences to just throwing money around and using your power for change, but if done in a responsible way, you can really change the world for the better.”</p><p><b>CS: Who/what were some of your inspirations when creating this song in particular?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “Interesting question. There are a couple people that I had in mind when writing it, but I also think that anyone can listen to the song and understand where I’m coming from. It’s not necessarily a song to specifically call out someone on, but more so if it offends you, maybe question why it’s offending you.”</p><p><b>CS: Who/what are some of your inspirations when creating your music in general?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “All of my music is based on personal experiences, or feelings, or even the way I’m perceiving something. I’m a huge empath as well, so I find it even more personal to me when I can take something from a form of media and write about it, also connecting the lyrics to myself in a way. An example of that would be my unreleased song ‘Apostate’ that I wrote about Lev from <i>The Last of Us</i>.”</p><p><b>CS: Is there a certain lyric within “Greed” that you are especially proud of?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “As I sit and read through the lyrics of ‘Greed,’ I really cannot pick a line that I like more than others. Some that stand out to me would be in the second half of the first verse, ‘trading gold for gold, rags been thrown aside — nothing to atone, if it isn’t in your face.’ I also really enjoy the line ‘as Seattle to rain, you’ll do again and again.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Auti-Press-Photo-1-Jeremy-Ryan-scaled.jpg><p><b>CS: If you could describe this song in three words, what would they be?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “I’d best describe this song as strong, intense and passionate.”</p><p><b>CS: If fans can take away one core message from this track, what would you want it to be?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “If fans can take away one core message, I want them to just listen to the lyrics and feel what they feel. Every line, every riff, every time one chorus gets louder than the next, feel that. For this song in particular, the music can be very intense and in your face, but I don’t want the message to get lost in that. So when you listen, listen.”</p><p><b>CS: If fans can take away one core message from your music as a whole, what would you want it to be?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “I think my biggest message as a human is ‘you’re not alone,’ which is meant in a sense of someone loves you, someone will be there for you in your darkest moments, but also that whatever you’re feeling mentally, as dark as it may go, someone else is feeling that or has felt that at some point in their life. Knowing that those same people have gotten through that darkness is a perfect reminder that you’ll be okay. As for my message in my music, I think it carries the same weight. As deep and emotional as a song may be or as fun and pop as it may get, vibe with that in whatever way you do and know that every line you’re listening to is something that I’ve felt.”</p><p><b>CS: What did the process look like creating “Greed” in particular? Were there any quirks to your method?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “The process was created from a simple guitar melody. When I was first writing the lyrics, it started off as this dark, toxic love song almost, and the only thing that stuck from that was the bridge because it resonated so well with the message of ‘Greed.'”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>CS: Is there a certain person that you really look up to when it comes to songwriting?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “I take a lot of inspiration from different artists, but there isn’t one in particular that I look up to when it comes to songwriting, I kind of just write. I will say that I think <a href=#><strong>Hozier</strong></a> is an incredible songwriter through and through.”</p><p><b>CS: Is there a certain person that you would want to co-write with someday?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “I think I’d like to write with Hozier one day, as well as some of <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>’s writers. Anyone that really knows me can vouch that 99% of the time, I’m listening to Ariana. The production on her music mixed with her tone and vocal ability is just so nice on the ears. I take a lot of inspiration from her, so to get to write with those who write and produce her music would be a dream come true. As for Hozier, I think he’s an incredible storyteller with his songwriting. It’s rare that you find that nowadays, so I think it’d be something special to write with him. I’d probably be super nervous for both though!”</p><p><b>CS: Is “Greed” a part of an upcoming project? If so, what can you tease to us?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “I’ve always thought that “Greed” had a <a href=#><strong>James Bond</strong></a> type of sound to it, which, no, it’s not in any 007 movies. I’m pretty sure they finished those up as well, so that’d be impossible at this point, but it will be on my EP that I’m releasing fairly soon!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Auti-Press-Photo-7-Jeremy-Ryan-scaled.jpg><p><b>CS: Do you have any plans for live performances in 2023? If so, what can fans expect to see at an Auti show?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “There’s nothing on the schedule as of right now, but I’m hoping to get out there eventually!”</p><p><b>CS: Do you have a certain city, venue or festival that you dream of performing at during your lifetime as a musician?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “I don’t have any venues or anything of the sorts I’m dying to perform in, but I would like to go overseas at some point. Maybe a big world tour one day, which I know is like every artist’s dream, but that’d be so sick! Specifically, I’ve always wanted to do something in Japan.”</p><p><b>CS: Do you have any goals for yourself in 2023 career-wise?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “I want to do a lot of shows in 2023 and get some recognition around my music and my message of mental health awareness.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;“</span></p><p><b>CS: Do you have any goals that you want to accomplish during your lifetime as a musician?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “In my lifetime as an artist, I want to spread light through my music and make a change in the world. Even if it’s as simple as changing one person’s life for the good, I’d be happy.”</p><p><b>CS: What has been the all-around most memorable moment in your musical journey so far?</b></p><p><strong>Auti:</strong> “I can’t pinpoint one most memorable moment, but I think sitting in the studio and watching my music come to life is memorable every time.”</p><p><strong>LISTEN TO “GREED” BELOW:</strong></p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span> <span class="ppma-category-group ppma-category-group-"><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_melanie has-avatar" readability=3.8374455732946><img data-del=avatar alt="Melanie Rooten" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_5785-Small-96x96.jpeg height=80 width=80 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Originally from Southern California and currently residing in Music City, Melanie graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a BA in Journalism before beginning her career as a music and entertainment journalist.
