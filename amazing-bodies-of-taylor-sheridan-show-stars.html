Before acting, Laird was modeling, and developed an eating disorder. She told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Hungertv.com</span></a><span> that picking up acting helped her get through this. "I was in New York about five years ago, and I had a really bad eating disorder. I was slowly coming out of that and I gained a bit of weight, and then my agents told me to lose weight again. I was like, 'I can't do this any more,'" she recalls. "So then, in New York, and not able to get work because I was 'too fat', I had a minute to switch off. So I found this acting school and I went to an open day, and this guy said, 'Yeah there's a spot on this two-month course, but it starts tomorrow.' So I had to move out of this model apartment that day because I couldn't stay there any more. I've never really properly thought about this, or said this, but that acting course… That course really saved me. I went through some really awful shit in the modelling world around that time, and going to those classes and being able to fall in love with something really saved my life."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_2233984275.jpg><p><span>Zoe Saldana plays the leading role of Joe on </span><i><span>Special Ops: Lioness. </span></i><span>She talked about how she approaches eating in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Byrdie</span></a><span>. "I try to be balanced. I don't like hearing, 'Oh, I'm doing this diet, or I'm doing that diet.' I like when people use words like 'my lifestyle.' When we use the word 'diet,' we're preparing ourselves for a big sacrifice that we know, the older we get, we're going to be too weak to fulfill. We just end up crashing and defeating ourselves. So I like telling myself that I'm not doing a diet, that this is my lifestyle, and I'm choosing to have a balanced meal. I don't like having zero carbs or all protein. I like getting all the nutrition that my body needs so that it can heal itself naturally."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_1490395427.jpg><p><span>Jill Wagner plays Bobby on </span><i><span>Special Ops: Lioness. </span></i><span>She revealed some of the charities and causes she supports to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>My Devotional Thoughts</span></a><span>.
