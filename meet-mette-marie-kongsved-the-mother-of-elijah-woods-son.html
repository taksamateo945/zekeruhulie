Her place of birth is Denmark, which makes her Danish by nationality, but her ethnic background is mixed.</p><p>Though the Danish is part of the glittering world of showbiz, she has managed to shield her family members from public scrutiny; thus, no one knows who her parents are, and it is not also known if she has siblings or grew up as an only child.</p><h2><strong>Is Mette-Marie Kongsved Married to Elijah Wood?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/84756522_198488094544600_4001699669398702910_n-2-e1671395382617.jpg><p>No, Mette-Marie Kongsved is not the wife of Elijah Wood. According to reports, the celebrity duo first crossed paths while working on the set of I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore in 2016. Elijah is an American actor and movie producer best known for his role in The Lord of the Rings.</p><p>The couple managed to keep their dalliance under wraps for a while until they were spotted in Pasadena, CA, holding hands around January 2018.

However, three long years have passed, and neither Elijah nor Kongsved deemed it necessary to confirm or refute the claims. Besides, Elijah was in an interview session during the later part of 2019 when he acknowledged Mette-Marie as his girlfriend and not fiancée.</p><p>It must be noted that the fact that Elijah and Kongsved seem not to be moving toward marriage does not mean that the movie actor is not interested in matrimony.
